    "- the findings from this project can help with the quick identification of pulsar star candidates which are incredibly important in the scientific study of extreme states of matter, exploration of planets beyond the solar system, in the measurement of distances in space, and potentially even in the study of blackholes. \n",
    "- by being able to use certain characteristics to predict or classify a detected emission as potentially being a pulsar star with a high estimation accuracy, this will allow scientists and astronomers to quickly identify pulsar star candidates with relative confidence and save them time from not having to do in depth and long-winded classification procedures for every single emission - allowing more time to be spent on the actual study of for example the solar system. The model that we create and the findings that will be created will be able to act as a sort of vetting process for pulsar star candidates to allow researchers to work more efficiently.  "

    "- our findings and project could also lead to questions such as these being asked: \n",
    "    - why do pulsar stars have those predictor variable characteristics? \n",
    "    - are the common characteristics between pulsar stars legitimate or was it just a lucky coincidence? \n",
    "    - since the predictor variables explored are continuous numeric values, are there any thresholds for each variable that determine if a star is potentially pulsar or not? Are there specific characteristics that have to be fulfilled in order for a star to be classified as pulsar? "
